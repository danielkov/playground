# playGround
Playfully clever CSS framework, designed mobile-first.
# Warning!
PlayGround is still under development, so using it in production is not recommended. Nothing is prefixed! Because it was designed to be used as a helper for larger projects, I recommend you use a prefixer plugin, such as autoprefixer.
